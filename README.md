# SymbolicMajoranas

Functionality for working symbolically with operators that are sums of products of Majorana operators on the sites of a lattice. It's still a work in progress.

## TODO
- Using arrays where tuples might be better.
- Some functions are better if they are not mutating. Also, some defined mutable types might be better off if they're made immutable.
- Implement nice printing.
