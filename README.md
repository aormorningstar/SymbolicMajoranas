# SymbolicMajoranas

Functionality for working symbolically with operators that are sums of products of Majorana operators on the sites of a lattice. It's still a work in progress.

## TODO
- Using arrays where tuples might be better.
- Try to make more types immutable and more functions non-mutating.
- Implement nice printing.
